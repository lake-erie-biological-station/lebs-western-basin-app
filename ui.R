  HTML("<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Erie Biological Station (LEBS), located in Sandusky, Ohio, is a field station of the USGS Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC).
       LEBS is the primary federal agency for applied fisheries science excellence in Lake Erie. 
       Since 2004, LEBS has participated in a collaborative, multiagency effort to assess forage fish populations in the western basin of Lake Erie. 
       The objectives of this evaluation are to provide estimates of abundance of key forage and predator species, 
       to assess seasonal and spatial distributions of fishes, and assess year class strength of key forage and predator species in the western basin of Lake Erie. 
       In 2012, the original vessel used since 2004, the R/V Musky II, was retired and replaced with the R/V Muskie. 
       The change in vessel neccessitated change in the net and all of the hardware needed to tow. 
       Previously, the survey also used a different catch processing protocol, which did not include measurments of biomass or length distributions of all species, and those historical datasets are not compatible with this presentation format. 
       Under the recently revised grid sampling design, we sampled 41 stations during two sampling periods that occurred in June (Spring) and September (Autumn). 
       The 2013 western basin survey season marked the first year in which the grid sampling design was employed in both spring and autumn. 
       Thus, we present data starting from 2013. This data presentation tool will automatically update with new data as we complete surveys in subsequent years.</p>"),
  HTML("<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel used for the survey is the R/V Muskie, a 70’ aluminum mono-hull research vessel, with a double-warp trawl system. 
       The net is a four-seam, three-bridle, bottom trawl, with a fishing circle of 200 x 12 cm meshes at the mouth of the net, and with ground gear consisting of a rock-hopper with 8” diameter floppy discs. 
       The cod end liner is constructed of 14 mm knotless dyneema mesh. The net is towed at a target speed of 3 knots, and wingspread estimates are obtained on each tow with an acoustic mensuration system to standardize catches per area swept. 
       Typical net geometry was a 6 m wingspread and 3 m headline height on each tow. 
       Typical area swept was 0.5 hectares. 
       Biomass was measured onboard with a motion compensating scale, and individual lengths and weights were obtained from sub-samples of each species’ size group. 
       Total counts were obtained by expansions of mean individual weight by the aggregate weight (by species and size group). 
       The exceptions to this method of enumeration were percids (Yellow Perch and Walleye), where every fish was counted, and size groups with low numbers (n<10), where each fish was measured.</p><br><br>"),
