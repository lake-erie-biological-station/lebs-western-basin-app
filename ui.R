  HTML("<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Erie Biological Station (LEBS), located in Sandusky, Ohio, is a field station of the USGS Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC).
       LEBS is the primary federal agency for applied fisheries science excellence in Lake Erie. 
       Since 2004, LEBS has participated in a collaborative, multiagency effort to assess forage fish populations in the western basin of Lake Erie. 
       The objectives of this evaluation are to provide estimates of abundance of key forage and predator species, 
       to assess seasonal and spatial distributions of fishes, and assess year class strength of key forage and predator species in the western basin of Lake Erie. 
       In 2012, the original vessel used since 2004, the R/V Musky II, was retired and replaced with the R/V Muskie. 
       The change in vessel necessitated changing the gear used to capture fish. 
       Previous surveys used a different catch processing protocol that did not include measurements of biomass or lengths of all species; thus, those historical data are not compatible with this presentation format. 
       Under the new protocol, 41 stations were sampled during June (Spring) and September (Autumn). 
       The 2013 western basin survey season marked the first year in which the grid sampling design was employed in both spring and autumn. 
       Thus, we present data starting from 2013. This data presentation tool will automatically update with new data as surveys are completed in future years.</p>"),
  HTML("<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel used for the survey is the R/V Muskie, a 70’ aluminum mono-hull research vessel, with a double-warp trawl system. 
       The net is a four-seam, three-bridle bottom trawl, with a fishing circle of 200 x 12 (cm) meshes at the mouth of the net, and with ground gear consisting of a rock-hopper with 8” diameter rubber discs. 
       The cod-end liner is constructed of 14 (mm) knotless dyneema mesh. The net is towed at a target speed of 3 knots, and wingspread estimates are obtained on each tow with an acoustic mensuration system to standardize catches per area swept. 
       Typical net geometry was a 6 (m) wingspread and 3 (m) headline height on each tow. 
       Typical area swept was 0.5 hectares. 
       Individual lengths and weights were obtained from a subsample of each species’ size group. 
       Total counts for each species and size group were obtained by expansions of mean individual weight by the aggregate weight. 
       The exceptions to this method of enumeration were percids (Yellow Perch and Walleye), where every fish was counted, and size groups with low numbers (n<10), where each fish was measured.</p><br>"),
